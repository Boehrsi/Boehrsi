### Used languages and tech üîß

I'm using different languages and tech to develop my software. I adapt to new solutions and ideas as often as possible, to stay up to date with current developments. Currently I'm using the following tech stacks.

- **Desktop + UI:** Java. But waiting for the full Dart + Flutter desktop support to switch
- **Android:** Java and Dart + Flutter. But mostly Flutter in the last months
- **Server:** Java and Kotlin. Transitioning to Kotlin only
- **Shell / consoles:** Bash
- **Web:** Hugo static side generator

I'm currently trying to focus on Dart + Flutter for all UI driven projects and on Kotlin for the server development. As I'm mainly an Android developer I also stay with Java for a bit, but I'm also trying to adapt my Kotlin knowledge for that area.
